* Description:

* Install:
  Write in ~/.bashrc (or other your shell config file)
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
if [ -e /path/to/ymd_cd.sh ]; then
    source /path/to/ymd_cd.sh
fi
    #+END_SRC

* Usage:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
y foo
  #+END_SRC
  -> If 'cd foo' fail, then the command search (partially-)matched directory from database

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
y =
  #+END_SRC
  -> Show database, which is composed of "integer,directory_name"

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
y -d bar
  #+END_SRC
  -> Delete "bar" from database. "bar" should be full path.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
y -c num
  #+END_SRC
  -> Clear database, except directories which still exist and it's arrival count are greater than "num".
  When no num is specified, num is assumed as 0. (Only non exist directories are deleted.)

* Database
  Shell variable YMD_CD_DATABASE, whose default value is "$HOME/.ymd_cd.db"
  It is sort before using.

* Optional
  Periodical manual backup of database is highly recommended
